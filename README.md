        b. Tap multiple times on a Jump button to jump onto something.
    Eat food to get some energy. More energy you have faster you can run and may jump higher;
    Don't eat too much... There is an alarm that will alert you when to stop eating;
    Collect coins so you may buy valuable items further in the game;
    Move boxes to jump onto something if necessary;
    Find or buy (game coins) the Bag to collect the items;
    Collect valuable items by tapping on them with the finger. This works only when you have the Bag;
    Use balls to hit some distant objects: for example, the box that maybe in help. Mouse may hold one ball at the time in the hands, when you throw the ball it will look for the same type of ball in the Bag.
